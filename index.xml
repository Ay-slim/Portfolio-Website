      <description>Electricity is a big deal; the life blood of the global economy without which not even the internet can work. This is why I chose to work on an electricity consumption dataset using time series analysis for my final capstone project at Stutern. The data was sourced from the London Smart meters Kaggle dataset and the plan is to eventually extend this application to the Nigerian electricity industry.
For this task, I engineered the location clusters and acorn classification features as exogenous variables for the LSTM and this gave a slightly lower error than another application where weather features were engineered as exogenous variables instead.</description>

      <description>With a dataset containing people contacted in the past and information about whether or not they donated, a charity organization seeks to identify the most likely donors amongst fresh set of data so as to minimize cost and maximize effect. This was an interesting project to work on as the data was a bit messy and heavily skewed requiring data cleaning and a log transformation on some numerical feature variables. Undersampling was also carried out to balance the dataset as a disproportionately large number in the training set did not give.</description>

      <description>This project involved building predictive models to classify the performance of loans given out by a commercial bank. The data is real world data from a financial institution in Nigeria. In addition to making predictions, we also involved a loan classification framework that can allow users to quickly estimate a given customer&amp;rsquo;s eligibility at a quick glance.
